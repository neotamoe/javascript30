    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const playersCopy = players;
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    playersCopy.push("Neota");
    // now here is the problem!
    players.forEach(player => console.log(player))
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const clone = players.slice(0);
    clone.push("Violet")
    clone.forEach(player => console.log(`clone: ${player}`))
    players.forEach(player => console.log(player))

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let concatCopy = []
    concatCopy = concatCopy.concat(players)
    concatCopy.push("Eli")
    concatCopy.forEach(player => console.log(`concatCopy: ${player}`))
    players.forEach(player => console.log(player))

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const spreadCopy = [...players]

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    spreadCopy.push("Sam")
    players.forEach(player => console.log(player))
    spreadCopy.forEach(player => console.log(`spreadCopy: ${player}`))

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const wes = person;
    person.title = "Instructor";
    const keys = Object.keys(wes)
    console.log(keys)  
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const wesCopy = {...person}
  
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    person.website = "JavaScript30";
    const keys2 = Object.keys(wesCopy);
    console.log(keys2)  
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
